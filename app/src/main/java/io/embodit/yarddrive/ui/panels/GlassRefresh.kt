/**
 * Keeps a glass panel's backdrop fresh (ported from Qianliyan, QA round 2 q2-1).
 *
 * `backgroundMaterial` is a property of the panel's graphics layer: the backdrop is composited into the
 * panel's frame when that layer is drawn. On the emulator a frame drawn before the backdrop is ready comes
 * up black over the region that frame repainted (a static panel shows a black band),
 * and a static panel never draws again, so the black stayed until the card was hidden. The call strip
 * recovered from the same black frame within a second or two because its live dot redraws all the time.
 *
 * Put this right after `backgroundMaterial(...)`: it re-records the whole material layer every
 * [REFRESH_MS] while the panel is composed, so a bad frame is repainted on the next tick.
